> Make a resume page

## Questions

- [ ] Should I have a tasks markdown file?
- [ ] How do I show people I can do it?

## Stream of Consciousness

I am going to be learning and using things. If You make a list of these things it will be easier to keep track of them. I can also use this list to make a resume page. I am using the React javascript framework.

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Next.js
- CSS
- HTML
- JavaScript
- Git
- Dev Ops

I currently like the gradient that was created in the boiler plate in Tailwind.

Should I use a `main` tag when I am working with pages?
